Hi I don't really know what to put here, just another website made from HTML and CSS.                                                                     
That branch named BS5Test will permanently stay as a seperate branch for me to experiment with a BS5 alternative since the current CSS looks fine.        
JS may be implemented later, although I do need to come up with a few ideas on what to do to actually implement it.                                       
If I do have time, I may also experiment with PHP in the future.
